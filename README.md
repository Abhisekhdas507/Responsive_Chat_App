# Responsive_Chat_App

 Responsive Chat Application 

This is a fully responsive chat interface built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project features an interactive layout where users can send messages and receive dummy responses from a bot.

##  Features

- Fully responsive single-page design
- Toggleable right-side chat panel
- Dark mode support
- Dummy chat interaction with bot
- Interactive buttons and icons using vanilla JavaScript
- Clean and modern UI built with custom CSS

##  Chat Functionality

Users can send messages through the chat input area, and a simple bot automatically responds with a pre-defined dummy reply. This feature simulates real-time conversation for UI/UX demonstration.

>  Note: This is a front-end-only implementation. The bot's response is hardcoded and no backend or AI is involved.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for semantic structure
- **CSS3** for styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** for interactivity

##  Responsiveness

The layout adapts seamlessly across devices  from large desktops to tablets and mobile phones  using media queries and flexible CSS units.
